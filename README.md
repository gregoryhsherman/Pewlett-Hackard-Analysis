# Overview

This analysis took a companies employees information and broke it down into more easily processed information. There is a massive
wave of people that are eligible for retirement coming up and the company might not be a position to continue with business as 
usual with a major loss of its workforce.

# Results

The "silver tsunami" is rapidly approaching, and there are a couple things that could help ease the potential loss of ten thousand employees.
1. Hire a lot of people.
2. There are more enough people that are in mid to upper level positions that can train new hires.
3. Create a new mid-upper level position for those that are eligible to retire but might not want to.
4. Consolidate the bottom level employees and have competitions for those who want to advance faster.

# Summary

The company is in a position to handle this major transition, but it will take some work. Namely, casting a big hiring net and
using those in higher positions to train the incoming work force.
